github oauth flow
 
https://api.github.com/user/orgs

This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with read:org scope, you can publicize your organization membership with user scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least user or read:org scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a 403 Forbidden response.
